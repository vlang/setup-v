GitHub Action that allows you to setup a V environment.

## Usage

```yaml
- uses: vlang/setup-v@v1.2
  with:
    # Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the repository. The PAT is configured
    # with the local git config, which enables your scripts to run authenticated git
    # commands. The post-job step removes the PAT.
    #
    # We recommend using a service account with the least permissions necessary.
    # Also when generating a new PAT, select the least scopes necessary.
    #

    #
    # Default: ${{ github.token }}
    token: ''

    # Version to use. It can be the branch, tag or SHA to checkout from the V repository.
    # Examples: 0.2.4, weekly.2022.07
    version: ''

    # File containing the version to use. It can contain the branch, tag or SHA to checkout from the V repository
    # Examples: .v-version
    version-file: ''

    # Set this option if you want the action to check for the latest available version of V.
    # If `stable` is false, it will check for the latest commit from the default branch.
    check-latest: false

    # Set this option if you want the action to use the stable version of V.
    # Will be ignored if `check-latest` is false.
    stable: false

    # Target architecture for V to use. Examples: linux, macos, windows. Will use system architecture by default.
    architecture: ''
```

## Output

This action will output the following variables:

- `bin-path`: Path to the directory that contains the V binary.
- `v-bin-path`: Path to the V binary.
- `version`: Version of V that was used.
- `architecture`: Architecture that was used to install V.
